for the sake of simplicity for evaluation,
I have given different codes for different maps as you don't need to change
any value inside the code



_______________________________________________


Run the following command to run the code
1. python easy_ana.py

and press enter as prompted

2. python hard_ana.py

and press enter as prompted



_________________________________________

for visualization purpose, pauses in the code is given so 
you just need to press enter to go next
